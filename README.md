# eeg-eye-state-lstm

Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a procedure that detects electrical activity of a personâ€™s brain. In this research paper we took a dataset of EEG readings and eye state (open or closed) as the output. 

The purpose of the research was to implement and analyze a LSTM based neural network model for eye state classification from EEG readings. We also compared our work with various previous approaches on EEG reading on eye state classification.

We have provided a python notebook that can be downloaded and run in google colaboratory. We have also provided a .csv file that contains our dataset.
